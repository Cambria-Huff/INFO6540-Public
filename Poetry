Let us go then, you and I 
When the evening is spread out against the sky,
Like a patienct etharized upon a table.
Let us go through certain half-deserted streets, 
The muttering retreats,
Of restless nights in one night cheap hotels 
And sawdust restaraunts with oyster shells.
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
That lead you to an overwhelming question.

Oh, do not ask "what is it"
Let us go and make our visit
In the room where women come and go, 
Taliking of Michealangelo.
